# Reversible-Data-Hiding
REQUIREMENTS:
1.	MATLAB Open Source Software
2.	Image and MATLAB code in the same folder
3.	Image should be .jpg ,.png formats 

 STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
1.	Open Matlab software and paste the embedding code.
2.	Put the name of image which is being used in ‘imread’ function in the code.
3.	Run the code to get the following output files:
•	Embedding Histogram
•	Image after embedding
•	Difference  Image after embedding
4.	Now after the embedding process paste the extraction code.
5.	Take the stego image(image after embedding) and put in ‘imread’ function in the code.
6.	Run the code to get the following output files:
•	Extraction Histogram
•	Image after extraction
